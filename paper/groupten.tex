\begin{abstract}
  We characterize two nearby moving groups, \groupTen\ and \groupSixteen,
  using \gaia\ DR 1, data from the literature, and Keck HIRES spectra.
  Notable members include XXX.
  The system is discovered as an aggregate of connected co-moving pairs in our recent study.
  Many of the member stars show signs of youth such as X-ray emission or infrared excess.
  We obtain low resolution spectra of the candidate members selected using proper motions, and
  show that the radial velocities for most of the candidates are indeed consistent
  with sharing the same velocity.
  The proximity of this \objname\  makes it an interesting place to study (special type of stars),
  and look for direct imaging planets.

\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Stars form in group, and remain coherent in their kinematics for a period of
time that, most importantly, depends on the mass of the initial mass of the
molecular clouds. Thus, looking for comoving groups of stars is an efficient
way to find moving groups of presumably single stellar population.

Simple stellar populations are useful for many things. Based on the assumption
that a group of stars have the same age, many of the stellar parameters can be
more precisely inferred. Particularly, stellar ages, which are important yet
challenging to constrain for a single star, can be pinned down to
\todo{$approx 10$\%} precision.

Young, hot stars are primary targets for discovering planets and brown dwarfs
with direct imaging.

Here, we report extended analysis and spectroscopic characterization of two
nearby moving groups.

\subsection{Previous identifications}
\label{subsec:history}

Moving group identifications are often scattered throughout the literature.
From a (non-exhaustive) bibliography review of all \tgas\ sources associated
with \groupTen\ and \groupSixteen\ using Simbad database, we note previous
identifications of these groups in the literature.

Some A-type stars that were selected in \citet{2017AJ....153..257O} as potential
members of \groupTen, 84 Uma, 81 Uma, XXX, were previously suggested by
Latyshev77

\subsection{Target Selection}
\label{sub:target_selection}

We re-examined the network of co-moving pairs studied in \citealt{2017AJ....153..257O} by
lowering the threshold of the marginalized likelihood ratios to be more inclusive.
For $\ln{\mathcal{L}_1}/{\mathcal{L}_2}>2$, we find that this group,
identified as group id 10 in \citealt{2017AJ....153..257O}, is extended to 45 potential members.

\section{Searching lower main sequence in GPS1}

We first find the lower main-sequence stars of the Pleiades (Group 0) using the
GPS1 data. The Pleiades is chosen as it is clearly very separated in
proper-motion space alone (Figure 1). We apply a simple cut in proper motions
to be within the minimum and maximum values of the TGAS-selected Group 0
members (indicated with a blue box in Figure 1, and query 15 degrees around the
center (median RA, Dec) of the group. There are 2095 stars satisfying the cuts
in the GPS1 catalog. Figure 2 shows their distribution in color-magnitude
diagrams using Gaia, 2MASS, and PanSTARRS photometry with MIST (\citealt{2016ApJ...823..102C}).

distribution in color-magnitude diagrams using Gaia, 2MASS, and PanSTARRS
photometry with the MIST isochrone of solar metallicity and 8.5~Myrs. Although
there is clearly contamination from background stars with this simple cuts, the
expected over-density in the low main-sequence is well recovered (and possibly
a few suspect WDs on the cooling sequence!).

However, there is a noticeable disagreement between the MIST isochrone and the
data in the red colors in that the model isochrone predict bluer colors than
observed. This is a known problem due to incomplete spectral library for
generating stellar spectral energy distributions from physical parameters
(Choi+2016).


We searched the Simbad (\citealt{2000A&AS..143....9W}) database for existing
radial velocity measurements of the candidate members
