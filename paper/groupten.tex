\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Comoving, coeval stars in the Solar neighborhood are valuable for
many different fields of astrophysics.
They are important benchmarks for our understanding of stellar physics
as well as for calibrating measurements among different mass ranges.
In the general picture that stars form in groups and remain
kinematically coherent until they are dissolved into the field population,
a detailed census of these objects is closely related to the recent star formation history
in the local volume.
The statistics of their kinematic properties may inform us about the dispersal
of kinematic coherence of young stars.

Each star cluster or moving group are also interesting dynamical entities
as their dynamical evolution is intimately tied to their internal structure and
external perturbation such as giant molecular clouds.

We are entreing a new era in charting the kinematic substructure and stellar
populations in the Solar neighborhood with the recent second data release (DR~2)
of \gaia\ \citep{2018arXiv180409365G}, which provides parallaxes, proper motions
and precise two-band photometry of stars brighter than $G=20$~mag as well as
radial velocities for stars brighter than 12~mag.

Previously, we performed a search for comoving pairs using the Tycho-Gaia
Astrometric Solution (\tgas), a subset of \gaia\ DR~1 which provides astrometric
measurements for 2~million source in Tycho-2 catalog ($G<12$~mag).
By looking for comoving pairs blindly, we have naturally recovered
many of the other larger known comoving stellar groups, ranging from
loose associations to open clusters.
However, we have also found some new large and small groups that
were not previously idendified.
% TODO: discuss Faherty 2018

% TODO: why group 10 stands out

Here, we confirm the existence of this \objname\ with \gaia\ DR 2 and
present an extended analysis of the properties.

\subsection{Previous identifications}
\label{subsec:history}

Moving group identifications are often scattered throughout the literature. We
reviewed a (non-exhaustive) bibliography associated with all \tgas\ sources in
\groupTen\ from our previous selection \citep{2017AJ....153..257O} using the
Simbad database, and note previous identifications of this group.

Some A-type stars that were selected in \citet{2017AJ....153..257O} as potential
members of \groupTen,
HIP 66198 (81 Uma), HIP 67231 (84 Uma), and HIP 67005, are part of an open cluster
suggested by \citet{1977ATsir.969....7L} and dubbed Latyshev 2 by Archinal \& Hynes.
The reality of the putative cluster, composed of 7 A-type stars
(HIP 66198,
HIP 67231,
HIP 67005,
HIP 67848,
HIP 66738,
TYC 3851-606-1,
TYC 3469-497-1)
was dismissed in a recent review by \citet{2016IAUS..314...21M}.
However, here we report that there indeed is a comoving group containing
some of the stars in Latyshev 2, and demonstrate
its physical reality more convincingly.
%
We found that two of the \hipparcos\ stars in Latyshev 2,
HIP 67848 (86 Uma) and HIP 66738 (83 Uma),
were missing in the \tgas\ catalog which was the parent sample of our previous search while
their proper motions have been determined by \hipparcos.
Motivated by this, we looked for any bright members of both groups that we
may have missed using \hipparcos\ stars that are not present in \tgas\ (\todo{see section X}).

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{g10_sky_pm.pdf}
  \caption{Distribution of stars in the local neighborhood of \groupTen\ on sky and in proper-motion space.}
  \label{fig:distributions}
\end{figure}

We use the astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic parameters of
\gaia\ DR~2.
Based on the angular and parallactic spread of this group from the previous
discovery using \tgas, we query the same region in \gaia\ DR 2 with generous
cuts applied in \ra, \dec, and parallax.
We go out to 20 degrees and 9 degrees from the mean position in \ra\ and \dec\
respectively, and a nominal 20~pc in distance around the median parallax.
There are \nstarsInRegion\ sources within these cuts.
Figure~\ref{fig:distributions} shows the distribution of these sources on sky
and in proper-motion space, where the black circles are
the original candidate members from \tgas.
While there is no discernable concentration of sources on sky,
a clear overdensity is found in proper-motion space at
$(\pmra,\,\pmdec)\approx(-16.8,\,-3)~\masyr$.
Of course, the sources in this overdensity do not have exactly the same proper motion
due to gemetric projection.
The span of this overdensity mainly corresponds to the span in parallax
(\figname~\ref{fig:distributions}c).
For the same 3D velocity vector, stars that are closer (larger parallaxes) will
have larger (absolute) proper motions.

In order to select candidate members of the group,
we have simply selected all stars within the ellipse marked in the lower two
panels of \figname~\ref{fig:distributions}.
We expect this selection to be neither complete nor without contamination.
However, given the clear overdensity in proper-motion space within this parallax slice
of the group, we expect the contamination to be low.
%TODO: some quantitative statement..
We think this selection is sufficient for a first attempt to examine the general
properties of the group.
Of 199 sources that fall in the ellipse mask in the proper-motion space,
there are 33 sources that have radial velocities (RVs) measured.
We exclude 1 source (Gaia DR2 1613400929985403520)
from this subset that has precise (standard error of 0.42~\kms) RV but is
a clear outlier, i.e., contamination.
% TODO: check coordinates and note assumed GC.
For the rest of the candidate members with RVs ($N=32$),
the median and standard deviation of the velocities in the Galactic coordinates
are $(U,\,V,\,W) = (-3.6,\,-9.1,\,-1.6)~\kms$ and
$(\sigma_U,\,\sigma_V,\,\sigma_W) = (0.59,\,0.88,\,1.24)~\kms$,
aptly described as `comoving'.
We treat these 198 sources as candidate members for the following analysis.


We note that 95\% of the selected candidate members have
parallax signal-to-noise ratios above 24.




% \section{Modelling as a group}
%
% Although the original selection was done by selecting comoving pairs, we can
% also model the proper motions of stars in a group (connected component) as drawn
% from a single mean velocity with a small dispersion.
% \todo{rephrase:
% This is essentially the moving cluster method or convergent point method,
% but instead of taking procedural steps to confirm or find the existence of a
% convergent point, we wish to take forward modelling approach with a probabilistic basis.}
% \todo{CITE: Lindegren etc.}
%
% The components of the model are:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item We assume that the velocity $\vec{v}_i$ of the star $i$ is drawn from
%     a single Gaussian component with mean (group) velocity $\vec{u}$ and
%     an isotropic dispersion $\sigma_{u}$:
%     $$\vec{v}_i \sim \normal(\vec{u},\,\sigma_{u}).$$
%     Then, the proper motion of star $i$ is $\mat{M}_i(\alpha_i,\,\delta_i)\vec{v}_i$ where
%     $\mat{M}_i$ is the rotation matrix that transforms the equatorial rectangular coordinates
%     \footnote{The choice of this coordinate system is arbitrary. Many of the studies on
%       moving grouops in the Solar neighborhood choose the Galactic coordinates which additionally
%       depends on $(\alpha_\mathrm{GC},\,\delta_\mathrm{GC})$.
%     }
%     to the tangential coordinates at the location $(\mathrm{R.A.},\,\mathrm{Decl.}) = (\alpha_i,\,\delta_i)$.
%
%   \item We assume that the noise model for the \gaia\ data is Gaussian, and
%     the covariance matrix $C_i$ is given and fixed:
%     $$(\tilde\varpi_i,\,\tilde\mu_{\alpha,i}^*,\,\tilde\mu_{\delta,i}) \sim
%       \normal((\varpi_i,\,\mu_{\alpha,i}^*,\,\mu_{\delta,i}),\,C_i)$$
%
%   \item \emph{Priors}: We assume a constant density prior ($p(r) \propto r^2$) and a Gaussian
%     prior with 30~\kms\ dispersion for the mean velocity of the group.
%     For the dispersion $\sigma_u$, we assume a uniform prior in $[0,\,50)$.

% We first do an optimization using L-BFGS algorithm starting from the

% We find that the optimized mean velocity is \meanVelocityOpt\ and the dispersion \sigVelocityOpt.
% We then sample the posterior distribution of $d_i$, $\vec{u}$ and $\sigma_u$ starting
% from this optimum.
% \figname~\ref{fig:quiver_pm} and \figname~\ref{fig:fit} summarizes
% the fit result.
%
%
% Because this group spans a large area on sky,
% the geometric constraint on the radial velocities of the stars is interesting.
% \todo{Figure:radial velocities}
% We compare this to a compilation of radial velcoity measurements from the literature.
% % We searched the Simbad (\citealt{2000A&AS..143....9W}) database for existing

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Color-magnitude diagrams and isochrone ages}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{bp_rp_G.pdf}
  \caption{
    Color-magnitude diagrams of candidate \groupTen\ members.
    Panel (a) and (c-f) show the color-magnitude diagram using \gaia\ (BP, RP and $G$),
    \tmass\ ($J$), \allwise\ ($W1$), and \panstarrs\ ($r_\mathrm{PS}$ and $i_\mathrm{PS}$)
    magnitudes. Panel (b) shows the astrometric excess noise from \gaia's astrometric
    solution vs. BP-RP color. The sources for which the excess noise is a significant
    outlier to the general trend are colored red.
    Some of the sources with bad BP, RP photometry are marked by `x'.
    Many of these seem to be low-mass stars further down the main sequence (d-f).
  }
  \label{fig:cmd}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{age_DavidHillenbrand2015.pdf}
  \caption{Age estimates for five candidate members in \citet{2015ApJ...804..146D}.
    The black vertical line is the mode of the posterior distribution,
    and the gray band and line marks 68\% and 95\% confidence interval.
  }
  \label{fig:age_DavidHillenbrand2015}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cmd}a shows the color-magnitude diagrams
of the candidate group members using \gaia\ photometry.
The absolute $G$ magnitude $M_G$ is calculated as $G + 5\log(\varpi) -10$ where
$\varpi$ is parallax in mas.
The group is at high galactic latitude (median $b=55$~degrees),
and the extinction is very low.
We checked the dust maps of \citet{1998ApJ...500..525S} and
\citet{2017ApJ...846...38L}
at the location of candidate and found the median reddening to be
$E(B-V)\lesssim 0.012$~mag although there are some variations across the region with
the maximum reddening of 0.025~mag.
We applied no correction for dust in data or isochrone models.

Compared to the distribution of stars in the entire search region (gray circles),
the candidate members (black circles) resemble a clean single-age population.
In order to estimate an approximate age of the group,
we compared the distribution of candidate members in the color-magnitude diagram
to MIST \citep{2016ApJ...823..102C} (with rotation) and
PARSEC isochrones \citep[v1.2S;][]{2012MNRAS.427..127B,2015MNRAS.452.1068C}
of solar metallicity visually,
and found $\log(\mathrm{age}) \approx 8.4$ (250~Myr).
We expect that a range of $\log(\mathrm{age}) = (8.2-8.55)$ should encapsulate
the plausible age of the group judging from the disagreement in lower-main
sequence for younger ages (with PARSEC models) and
the main-sequence turn-off for older ages.
Isochrones of $\log(\mathrm{age}) \approx 8.4$
from MIST (black) and PARSEC (blue) models are plotted in \figname~\ref{fig:cmd}a
for comparison.
The discrepancy between the MIST models and the data for low-mass
($M\lesssim0.6~m_\odot$) stars is a well-known problem seen in many young open
clusters and generic in many stellar models, and is attributed to incomplete
atomic and molecular line opacity data.
This is remedied in PARSEC models by revising and calibrating the boundary conditions
to match the observed data in star clusters \citep{2014MNRAS.444.2525C}, leading to
a better agreement with the data.
A more careful modelling is required to properly infer the age and metallicity
of the group.

At the very faint end, the \gaia\ BP-RP colors are may be incorrect due to
contamination from nearby sources as no deblending was performed for BP and RP
bands in DR~2 \citep{2018arXiv180409368E}.
Following \citet{2018arXiv180409378G}, we used emperical cuts to the
\texttt{phot\_bp\_rp\_excess\_factor} as a function of BP-RP color in order to
flag these sources which are marked as `x' in all panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:cmd}.
In order to illuminate the nature of these sources, we use four other deeper
survey magnitudes (\tmass\ $J$, \allwise\ $W1$ and \panstarrs\ $r$ and $y$) with
\gaia\ $G$ band magnitudes.
%
Many of these sources seem to be lower-mass stars further down the main-sequence
with even redder colors.


For five \hipparcos\ stars of the candidate members,
an independent age determination by \citet{2015ApJ...804..146D} exists.
The stars were treated as field stars and modelled individually.
We used the cross-match to Tycho-2 provided in the Gaia Archive
in order to retrieve the \hipparcos\ identifiers.
Figure~\ref{fig:age_DavidHillenbrand2015} shows the posterior distributions
of their age estimates.
Except for one star, HIP 69275, with a notable disagreement with the rest,
four out of five stars have a consistent most probable age of $202-214$~Myr
(mode of the posterior distribution) and overlapping posterior distributions.
This is in good agreement with the visually-determined isochrone age.
