  We characterize a nearby (\todo{$d \approx \groupDistanceEstimate$}),
  young (\todo{age $\approx \groupAgeEstimate$}) moving group using \gaia\ DR 1
  astrometry and photometric and spectroscopic data from the literature.
  This group, which notably includes \todo{81 Uma},
  partially overlaps with the putative new open cluster composed of
  seven A-type stars by \citet{1977ATsir.969....7L} but its status
  was dubious due to ...
  Here, we show that three of these stars are part of a larger comoving group
  that have \totalNumberOfCandidates\ candidate members.
  We model the proper motions of the candidate members with a simple
  isotropic Gaussian velocity distribution, and find that
  the velocity dispersion is very small (\todo{X}) verifying
  that they are comoving.
  Because the group spans a large area on sky, the astrometric radial velocities
  of individual stars based on the model is determined with \todo{this precision}.
  We discuss ....

\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Stars form in group, and remain coherent in their kinematics for a period of
time that, most importantly, depends on the mass of the initial mass of the
molecular clouds. Thus, looking for comoving groups of stars is an efficient
way to find moving groups of presumably single stellar population.

Simple stellar populations are useful for many things. Based on the assumption
that a group of stars have the same age, many of the stellar parameters can be
more precisely inferred. Particularly, stellar ages, which are important yet
challenging to constrain for a single star, can be pinned down to
\todo{$approx 10$\%} precision.

Young, hot stars are primary targets for discovering planets and brown dwarfs
with direct imaging.

Here, we report extended analysis and spectroscopic characterization of two
nearby moving groups.

\subsection{Previous identifications}
\label{subsec:history}

Moving group identifications are often scattered throughout the literature. We
reviewed a (non-exhaustive) bibliography associated with all \tgas\ sources in
\groupTen\ from our previous selection \citep{2017AJ....153..257O} using the
Simbad database, and note previous identifications of this group.

Some A-type stars that were selected in \citet{2017AJ....153..257O} as potential
members of \groupTen,
HIP 66198 (81 Uma), HIP 67231 (84 Uma), and HIP 67005, are part of an open cluster
suggested by \citet{1977ATsir.969....7L} and dubbed Latyshev 2 by Archinal \& Hynes.
The reality of the putative cluster, composed of 7 A-type stars
HIP 66198,
HIP 67231,
HIP 67005,
HIP 67848,
HIP 66738,
TYC 3851-606-1,
TYC 3469-497-1,
was dismissed in a recent review by \citet{2016IAUS..314...21M}.
However, here we report that there indeed is a comoving group containing
some of the stars in Latyshev 2, and that we have identified the lower-MS stars
in \tgas, demonstrating its physical reality more convincingly.
We found that two of the \hipparcos\ stars in Latyshev 2,
HIP 67848 (86 Uma) and HIP 66738 (83 Uma),
were missing in the \tgas\ catalog which was the parent sample of our previous search while
their proper motions have been determined by \hipparcos.
Motivated by this, we looked for any bright members of both groups that we
may have missed using \hipparcos\ stars that are not present in \tgas\ (\todo{see section X}).

\subsection{Target Selection}
\label{sub:target_selection}

We re-examined the network of co-moving pairs studied in \citealt{2017AJ....153..257O} by
lowering the threshold of the marginalized likelihood ratios to be more inclusive.
For $\ln{\mathcal{L}_1}/{\mathcal{L}_2}>2$, we find that this group,
identified as group id 10 in \citealt{2017AJ....153..257O}, is extended to 45 potential members.

\section{Modelling as a group}

Although the original selection was done by selecting comoving pairs, we can
also model the proper motions of stars in a group (connected component) as drawn
from a single mean velocity with a small dispersion.
\todo{rephrase:
This is essentially the moving cluster method or convergent point method,
but instead of taking procedural steps to confirm or find the existence of a
convergent point, we wish to take forward modelling approach with a probabilistic basis.}
\todo{CITE: Lindegren etc.}

The components of the model are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We assume that the velocity $\vec{v}_i$ of the star $i$ is drawn from
    a single Gaussian component with mean (group) velocity $\vec{u}$ and
    an isotropic dispersion $\sigma_{u}$:
    $$\vec{v}_i \sim \normal(\vec{u},\,\sigma_{u}).$$
    Then, the proper motion of star $i$ is $\mat{M}_i(\alpha_i,\,\delta_i)\vec{v}_i$ where
    $\mat{M}_i$ is the rotation matrix that transforms the equatorial rectangular coordinates
    \footnote{The choice of this coordinate system is arbitrary. Many of the studies on
      moving grouops in the Solar neighborhood choose the Galactic coordinates which additionally
      depends on $(\alpha_\mathrm{GC},\,\delta_\mathrm{GC})$.
    }
    to the tangential coordinates at the location $(\mathrm{R.A.},\,\mathrm{Decl.}) = (\alpha_i,\,\delta_i)$.

  \item We assume that the noise model for the \gaia\ data is Gaussian, and
    the covariance matrix $C_i$ is given and fixed:
    $$(\tilde\varpi_i,\,\tilde\mu_{\alpha,i}^*,\,\tilde\mu_{\delta,i}) \sim
      \normal((\varpi_i,\,\mu_{\alpha,i}^*,\,\mu_{\delta,i}),\,C_i)$$

  \item \emph{Priors}: We assume a constant density prior ($p(r) \propto r^2$) and a Gaussian
    prior with 30~\kms\ dispersion for the mean velocity of the group.
    For the dispersion $\sigma_u$, we assume a uniform prior in $[0,\,50)$.
\end{itemize}

    Comparing astrometric radial velocities (blue patches) to
    measurements available from the literature (black circles).
    The stars are spread along their R.A. in the vertical direction.
    The blue patches for each star shows the posterior distribution
    of the star's radial velocity predicted from the proper motions of
    all stars in the group.
    All available measurements removing duplicated exact values from
    the literature are shown.
    In general, the the predicted astrometric RVs match one or more
    available measurements for a star.
  }
  \label{fig:rv_ra_id}
\end{figure}

We first do an optimization using L-BFGS algorithm starting from the
initial values $d_{i,0} = 1/{\tilde \varpi_0}$, a random mean velocity $\vec{u}_0$
drawn from the prior distribution, and $\sigma_u=10$~\kms.
We find that the optimized mean velocity is \meanVelocityOpt\ and the dispersion \sigVelocityOpt.
We then sample the posterior distribution of $d_i$, $\vec{u}$ and $\sigma_u$ starting
from this optimum.
\figname~\ref{fig:quiver_pm} and \figname~\ref{fig:fit} summarizes
the fit result.


Because this group spans a large area on sky,
the geometric constraint on the radial velocities of the stars is interesting.
\todo{Figure:radial velocities}
We compare this to a compilation of radial velcoity measurements from the literature.
We searched the Simbad database ...
